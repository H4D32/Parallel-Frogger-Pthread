# Parallel-Frogger-Pthread

## About


### This repository

This is my implementation of the Frogger game that runs with parallel threads responsible for the different elements in the game.
This was originally an assignment given in the Operating system course in The Chinese University of Honk Kong, Shenzhen

### Plagarism

If you are here from CUHK-SZ I will only ask you to not send my exact codes/screenshots for your Assignment. (you will get a 0)
Thank you <3

## Implementation 

The implementation is done in C++ with pthread, for details look at the report pdf and the source code under source/frogger.cpp
